Greetings!

My name is Natalie, and I've spent the last few years working as an archivist, but recently moved into software development. I recently completed an 18 week bootcamp in front end development at Promineo Tech with Nashville State Community College. On this page, you can find repositories for some of the code I worked on in the program, as well as my individual projects.

**natalie-goodwin/Natalie-Goodwin** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
